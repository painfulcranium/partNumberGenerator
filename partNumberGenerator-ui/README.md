# PartNumberGeneratorUi

This project is a front end for the partNumberGenerator API application that serves data via REST.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Assumptions

You have pulled this application code, and run `npm install` to make sure all libraries are downloaded.

You are running the accompanying REST API application in this project and have started it and it is currently running on http://localhost:8080

You have no pre-conceptions about hoe horrible this UI looks, as it is merely an example to demonstrate some of the things that can be done with 
Angular. This is by no means meant to be anything other than a demo ;) You have been warned :)

You will probably find bugs...nobody is perfect, we all have them, and we all learn all the time ;) Please be gentle ;)

## Exclusions

No routing was added to this project as to keep it simple as a 'demo' (did I mention that already? :)

No security was added to this project, again to keep it simple. I a real application, there would be JWT tokens, headers, and all sorts of fun stuff flying around this code, but again, it is a demo ;)
